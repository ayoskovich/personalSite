<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>  My name is Anthony and you’ve found my corner of the internet. In April 2020 I will be graduating from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Economics. I also have a math minor.</p>

</p>
<p>  I am currently an Advanced Analytics intern at Steelcase, one of the largest office furniture manufacters on the planet. Here I leverage python, R, SQL, and a suite of Microsoft Azure products to analyze data and build models advancing the firm’s strategic objects. I work closely with business professionals to interpret and share these models, and I have learned an enormous amount about how to be an ambassador for effective analytics.</p>
<p>  There is an art to translating the business pain point into a mathematical model. There is also an art in translating that business pain point into a representation using a programming language. The problem may change, or the deliverable may change formats. I try my best to write modular and testable code that can rapidly be pivoted or used in other ways.</p>
<p>  This site hosts my random thoughts, programmy things, statisticy things, and economics things. I enjoy riding bikes, taking pictures with film cameras, and good office furniture!</p>
