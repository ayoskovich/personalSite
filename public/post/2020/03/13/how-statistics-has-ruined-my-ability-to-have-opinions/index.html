<p>&emsp; For the past 4 years I have been studying statistics. Doing lots of practice problems, playing around with data, and reading textbooks. I&rsquo;ve become a bit more familiar with the statistical way of thinking, how to analyze problems in terms of distributions rather than single numbers, and how to work with uncertainty. As much as I&rsquo;ve loved this, it has had quite the unexpected consequence in my personal life.</p>

<h3 id="emsp-i-find-it-hard-to-have-an-opinion-about-anything">&emsp; I find it hard to have an opinion about anything.</h3>

<p>&emsp; Thinking about a data generating process as single shot ocurrences isn&rsquo;t a good way to frame problems. A better way would be to ask, &ldquo;What would happen if we did this thing a bunch of times&rdquo;. When attempting to effectively evaluate hypotheses, thinking about the distribution of events is often more helpful than looking at single occurrences. You don&rsquo;t hear about clinical trials with 1 patient or a brake pad company testing on 1 car. We want the largest sample possible because it gives us the clearest picture of the population and reduces variability.</p>

<p>&emsp; Now back to my life (it is my website after all). Go out to a restaurant and have a bad experience? Well, I&rsquo;ve only been there once so maybe it was just an off night. Take a new route home from work? Wow that was quick! But wait, I&rsquo;m not taking into account the time of day or day of the week.</p>

<p>&emsp; I can&rsquo;t help but be reminded of these scenes from Silicon Valley (NSFW language).</p>
