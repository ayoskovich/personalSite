<p>&emsp; I use jupyter notebooks quite a bit and have developed a workflow that allows me to leverage python modules in order to give the notebook more structure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U" target="_blank">This</a> talk does a great job describing some problems and pain points I have also encountered when working in a notebook environment.</p>

<p>&emsp; Most times if I work exclusively in a notebook I tend to not be very smart with the program architecture due to the ability to execute cells in an arbitrary order that I forget about. Then, when I restart the kernel, everything explodes and I&rsquo;m left confused due to all the hidden variables and states that were hovering in the workspace.</p>

<p>&emsp; There are a few advantages to importing functions relevant to the analysis as modules.</p>

<ol>
<li>The notebook immediately becomes less cluttered.</li>
<li>External modules can be tested.</li>
<li>External modules can be re-used.</li>
<li>Analysis paths can rapidly be changed or pivoted due to this modular structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>&emsp; I created a notebook that demonstrates this idea and can be found <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ayoskovich/personalSite/blob/master/pyNotebooks/housing/housePrices.ipynb?flush_cache=True" target="_blank"> here</a>. The imported modules can be found <a href="https://github.com/ayoskovich/personalSite/tree/master/pyNotebooks/housing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
