I am a recent graduate of Statistics and Economics seeking employment opportunities where I can leverage many data sources to solve complex business problems.


I recently finished studying Statistics and Economics for 4 years and am excited to enter the job market. While in college I have gained valuable skills utilizing statistics to solve problems, as well as understanding foundational Economic theories and their applications. I love communicating with other people, and believe that good data science is impossible without having soft skills and being able to communicate results.


As a recent graduate of Statistics and Economics I've gained exposure to many statistical techniques, mathematical ideas, and economic theories. I have had lots of practice grinding out practice problems and know that the key to making progress is small, consistent work. I have experience communicating complex results in easy to digest manners.
