I built an [online calculator](http://www.amisaving.com) to help people save money. After entering the costs associated with 2 spending options the calculator outputs the breakeven number of purchases between the two options. For example: 

> Before 30 purchases you save money with Option A and after 30 purchases you save money with Option B.

Here are some example decisions the calculator can help with: 

- Make coffee at home or go to starbucks. 
- Buy the unlimited pass at the carwash or pay each visit. 
- Rent a chainsaw each time you need one or just buy one.

I've also made a [quick 2 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUKujjKL9Ys) explaining how to use the calculator.

## Why I Made This
Lots of cost saving online calculators exist but they are primarily geared towards deciding about renting vs. buying housing. As a consequence, they require lots of user input and are not well suited for the more general idea of "renting vs. buying".

The primary goal of this tool is to be quick to use and useful for many different comparisons. I imagine this being used by people in grocery aisles.

That's it for the overview of the project, and everything after this discusses the technical aspect of this.

## Technical Work
When I started this project I had a few goals. I wanted to:

1. Use a new python library
2. Deploy the project
3. Visualize results
4. Make something genuinely useful for me and others


## Further Work
- Timevalue

- Personal account with timevalue
  - Accounts would have different comparison profiles
  - Notifications when money is saved
  - Summaries of monthly / yearly savings or spendings
