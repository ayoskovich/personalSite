## Motivation
My internet has been kind of spotty lately which made me want to understand a few things about the speed.

1. Variability (time of day, dow)



## Tech
- vim (parsing log files)
  - `hardmode` plugin
- bash (creating log files)
  - cron (for automation)
  - `>`, `>>`
- internet in general (for analysis)
