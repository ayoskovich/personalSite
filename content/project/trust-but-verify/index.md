## Motivation

A recent [bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-11/why-chicken-is-plentiful-during-the-pandemic-and-beef-is-not?srnd=premium&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=markets&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&sref=XQtHDW1P) authored by [Justin Fox](https://twitter.com/foxjust) piqued my interest. 


## What's the point
Is this going to be easy to do or hard? Clearly I could reach out to the author of the article directly and ask about the process, but is that how it should be? What is the expectation for putting numeric estimates in articles? The author here has cited a few sources, but all I get to is the over arching site. It's now my job to go and try and find the data used.

If there is a huge difference in me getting it myself and what the author did, should the author be expected to be more explicit about the data gathering / analyzing process?

## Goals

1. See if I can recreate some of the numbers he describes in his post (not because I don't believe him, but I'm just curious).
  - "poultry costs U.S. consumers 62% less in inflation-adjusted terms than it did in 1935"
  - "Pork, now also raised mostly at factory scale indoors, is 12% cheaper"
  - "Beef, which isnâ€™t, costs 63% more. "
  - 'U.S. Consumption of Boneless Meat' Graph, U.S. Department of Agriculture
  
2. Take his article a step further in some aspects.
  - TODO
