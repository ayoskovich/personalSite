## Motivation

A recent [bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-11/why-chicken-is-plentiful-during-the-pandemic-and-beef-is-not?srnd=premium&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=markets&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&sref=XQtHDW1P) authored by [Justin Fox](https://twitter.com/foxjust) piqued my interest. In the article, Fox describes how the prices and consumption of 3 different types of meat have changed over time. He gives some good insights into why the price of chicken has stayed relatively low in recent years (due to the ease of automation). I would encourage you to give the article a read. 

In the article, Fox brings up a large amount of statistics and percentages. My goal here is to go out, find the data he references, and perform an identical analysis. Then, I'll see if I get the same numbers as him. I'll just say here that I'm not calling into question Fox's statistics. This is more meant to be an exercise in reproducible research than anything.

## Goals
Like any good project, let's create some concrete goals.

1. Recreate some of the numbers he describes in his post.

2. Take his article a step further in some aspects.
  - How has the price change in recent times differed between the different types of meat?
  

## Process
I decided to go to where he points in order to get the data. If you aren't interested in the technical details, feel free to skip to the conclusion.
