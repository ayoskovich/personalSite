Hello! My name is Anthony Yoskovich and I am currently a senior at Grand Valley State University. I plan to receive a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics and Economics in April of 2020. Outside of the classroom I'm an Advanced Analytics intern at Steelcase, and here I wrangle and analyze data using R, python, SQL, and many more technologies.

## Why make a website?
I first created a personal website in February 2018. I had been completing small projects and analyses outside of the classroom but didn't have a place to show them off, so I decided to build something myself. I've used a couple different technologies in order to create the site (raw html, bootstrap, and R), and it's currently built using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
