<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>  My name is Anthony and you’ve found my own corner of the internet. In April 2020 I will be graduating from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Economics. I also have a math minor.</p>

</p>
<p>  I am currently an Advanced Analytics intern at Steelcase, one of the largest office furniture manufacters on the planet. Here I leverage python, R, SQL, databricks, and other Microsoft Azure products to analyze data and build models advancing the firm’s strategic objects. I work closely with business professionals to interpret and share these models, and have learned an enormous amount about how to be an ambassador for good data &amp; analytics.</p>
<p>  My programming skills have improved a TON since I’ve been working in the real world. I understand the importance of modular and testable code, especially when writing code that will be used a long time.</p>
<p>  This site hosts my random thoughts, programmy things, statisticy things, and economics things. I enjoy riding bikes, taking pictures with film cameras, and good office furniture!</p>
