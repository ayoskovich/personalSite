<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>  My name is Anthony and you’ve found my corner of the internet. In April 2020 I will be graduating from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Economics. I also have a math minor.</p>

</p>
<p>  I am currently an Advanced Analytics intern at Steelcase, one of the largest office furniture manufacters on the planet. Here I leverage python, R, SQL, and a suite of Microsoft Azure products to analyze data in a way that advances the firm’s strategic objects. I work closely with business professionals to interpret and share results, and I am learning an enormous amount about how to be an ambassador for effective analytics.</p>
<p>  Translating a business problem into a mathematical model is truly an artform. When using technologies such as python to implement and evaluate these models, my philosophy is to write modular and testable code that can be easily augmented. Clean code is the best way to ensure that when business needs change the analysis path can rapidly adapt.</p>
<p>  This site hosts my random thoughts, programmy things, statisticy things, and economics things. I enjoy riding bikes, taking pictures with film cameras, and good office furniture!</p>
