<h2>Hello!</h2>

</p>
<p>  I am currently an Advanced Analytics intern at Steelcase, one of the largest office furniture manufacters on the planet. Here I leverage python, R, SQL, databricks, and Microsoft Azure products to build data science models that provide the company value. I work closely with business professionals to interpret and share these models, and have learned an enormous amount about anayltics consulting.</p>
<p>  My programming skills have improved a TON since I’ve been working in the real world. I understand the importance of modular, testable code, especially when writing code that will be used a long time.</p>
<p>  This site hosts some personal projects of mine and I encourage you to look around. I enjoy python, R, riding bikes, and good office furniture!</p>
