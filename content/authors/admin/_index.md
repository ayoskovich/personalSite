I strive to be an effective thought partner that fuses quantitative data with qualitative knowledge. While I have the technnical skills in Python, SAS, and R to perform complex analyses, I believe my communication and consulting skills set me apart. This website is meant to display the wide breadth of my skills, interests, and even some of my personality!
