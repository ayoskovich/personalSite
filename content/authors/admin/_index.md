I strive to be an effective thought partner to deliver actionable insights using technologies like Python, R, SAS, and many others. I am just as comfortable inverting a matrix as I am communicating complex analyses to non-technical stakeholders and am always on the lookout for opportunities to intertwine analytical models with business processes.
