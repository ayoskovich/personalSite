# Basic Operations Research Models

I'm going to use the `lpSolve` package in order to solve 3 basic OR problems. The notation shows the problems in standard form. 

### 1. Allocation 

In an allocation problem, the amount of resources available to the decision variables is fixed.
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{p}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{i,j,k} f_{j}
$$


```{r}
coeff <- c(30, 40, 80)
```


### 2. Blending Models

In a blending model, the amount of resources available to the decision variables is unlimited, but we normally want to minimize cost.


### 3. Shift Scheduling

These models are arguably the most easily seen as the most relevant.
