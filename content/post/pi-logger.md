I recently picked up a Raspberry Pi v4 and have built a nice little data logger. I've got a python script that calls an api once every 40 seconds ish and saves the result to a text file.

I'm working on a flask app to serve some sort of dashboard on the local network. I was trying to have the pages play a sound effect automatically when something happened but I've been having trouble because most browsers don't support autoplaying audio.

I've also been working a bit with Docker, got some project ideas about it but don't want to share too much to soon.
