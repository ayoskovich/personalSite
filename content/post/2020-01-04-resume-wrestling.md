Over my time in college I've used many different types of word processing software in order to create resumes / cover letters. I've used local installs of Microsoft Word (bleh), Google Docs (bleh bleh), Overleaf (not very bleh), and even Powerpoint (BLEH). Recently I've been getting more in to the command line and have been using latex. I'm thinking of creating a git repo in order to track changes I make to the document, that way I can access it from both my laptop and desktop. I could also create a button up top that would direct individuals to a pdf version of my resume.

**EDIT (1/9/2020):** Private repos are free on gitHub, so both documents are there now, hiding from the public's view...
