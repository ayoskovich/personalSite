I like weighing out raw coffee each morning before I make it it, but I no longer have access to the scale I was using. A quick google search yields that a single coffee bean weighs around .13 grams of coffee, so for my normal 23g cup in the morning I've been counting out around 172 coffee beans (which only takes around 3 minutes lol).

Bean weight probably varies by the roast level / type of coffee, and it would be nice to create some sort of reference document that aids in the `"how many beans do I need for X amount of coffee"` calculations.

The irony here is that I would use the document in situations when I didn't have a scale, but to create the document I'd need to buy a scale first. 

The wallet must suffer in the pursuit of science!
