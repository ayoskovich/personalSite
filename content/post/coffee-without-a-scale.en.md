I do pourover coffee each morning and I like to weight out the coffee. However, the scale I was using has left alongside my roommate who just moved out.

I'd like to do a project where I estimate the weight of a single coffee bean. Obviously it would be a tad bit counter-intuitive. First I need to get a scale, in order to estimate the weight of a coffee bean...so I can determine the weight of coffee without using a scale...
