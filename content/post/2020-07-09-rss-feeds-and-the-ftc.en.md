### The RSS part

I feel like a lot of people subscribe to this belief that the only way to aggregate news is to visit sites like twitter, facebook, youtube, and other social media platforms. The philosophical implications I believe this has isn't in the scope of this post. But, by using RSS feeds you can do all that aggregation yourself, and with no ads. 

RSS feeds solve the problem of, "I have all these sites I visit frequently and I want to know when they update or create new content." 

I use `newsboat` in order to subscribe to RSS feeds of some particular parts of the internet I frequent. `newsboat` is terminal based which I like, and has a very simple text file that configures the feeds you want to subscribe to.

### The FTC part

After studying economics for 4 years I'm a big fan of the FTC. There seems to be a lot of sentiment of businesses treating consumers poorly, and not enough people give credit to the government agency tasked with "protecting America's consumers". 

One of the specific feeds I'm subscribed to is the FTC's business blog. Today, it featured this elegant bit of text from Lesley Fair...

> But based on the illegal conduct alleged in a lawsuit just filed by the FTC, maybe itâ€™s because the URL SuperDeceptivePractices.com was already taken. 

Anti trust economics was interesting to me.
