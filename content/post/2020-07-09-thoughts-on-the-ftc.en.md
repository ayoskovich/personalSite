I'd like to shed some light on the government organization tasked with protecting consumers from bad practices. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc) (FTC) is the government organization who's mission according to their website is:

> Protecting consumers and competition by preventing anticompetitive, deceptive, and unfair business practices through law enforcement, advocacy, and education without unduly burdening legitimate business activity. 

Created in 1914, the FTC investigates things like:

1. Mergers (vertical and horizontal)
2. False advertising
3. Anticompetitive behavior (price fixing, dumping, limit pricing)

### Zoom in 

I'd like to focus on #3, anticompetitive behavior, which is usually grouped into 2 types, horizontal conduct and single firm conduct. More info on these [here](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/anticompetitive-practices). Horizontal conduct is behavior happening __between__ firms (price fixing), and single firm conduct happens within an individual firm.

A company having a monopoly is not inherently unlawful, and neither is attempting to get a monopoly position using aggressive methods. However by using unreasonable methods IS illegal. The FTC makes a very important distinction between these 2 things. And in the end, the FTC's job is to protect __consumers__, not protect competitors from competition. 

> The FTC's Bureau of Competition, working in tandem with the Bureau of Economics, enforces the antitrust laws for the benefit of consumers.

For example, Walmart is probably a monopoly in a lot of places, but consumers gain massive benefits from the scale and efficiency Walmart operates at. Shorter lines, cheaper prices, more options, all these things are good for consumers.
