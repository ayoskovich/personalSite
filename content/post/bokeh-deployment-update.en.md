My most recent dashboard is very close to being complete, and you can view it live [here](https://amisaving.herokuapp.com/) and the code [here](https://github.com/ayoskovich/amisaving). I finally got my external style sheet working and the remaining work is just cosmetic.

Here's my todo list:

- [ ] Make the site easier on the eyes
- [ ] Include some instructional text on how to use the tool
- [ ] Format the "answer" in an easier to read way

I plan to add this dashboard to the projects section of my site once these items are complete. I have been using lots of new technologies throughout this, especially for the deployment, and maybe I'll create a video walkthrough of the technical work.

## Keyboard update

Also, I recently bought an [ergodox keyboard](https://ergodox-ez.com/) with cherry mx white switches. Click the link below to see my current layout! I use my thumbs to hit those weird buttons towards the middle and I'm loving it so far.


<div style="padding-top: 60%; position: relative;">
