<div id="basic-operations-research-models" class="section level1">
<h1>Basic Operations Research Models</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m going to use the <code>lpSolve</code> package in order to solve 3 basic OR problems. The notation shows the problems in standard form.</p>
<div id="allocation" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Allocation</h3>
<p>In an allocation problem, the amount of resources available to the decision variables is fixed.
<span class="math display">\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{p}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{i,j,k} f_{j}
\]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>coeff &lt;- c(30, 40, 80)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="blending-models" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Blending Models</h3>
<p>In a blending model, the amount of resources available to the decision variables is unlimited, but we normally want to minimize cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="shift-scheduling" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Shift Scheduling</h3>
<p>These models are arguably the most easily seen as the most relevant.</p>
