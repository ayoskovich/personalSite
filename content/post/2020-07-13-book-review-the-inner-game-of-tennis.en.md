## Thesis of the book
W. Timothy Gallwey's book discusses mental performance using tennis as an example. No prior knowledge of tennis is necessary to extract the big ideas of the book.


## Likes
Gallwey's voice is consistent and clear, and he presented his ideas in a cohesive and easy to digest format. Towards the end of the book he briefly discusses the nature of competition. I found his insights on the cultural impacts of the view of competition very unique and he presented ideas that I have not heard of before.

## Dislikes
While the book is called The Inner Game of Tennis, I felt that at times he gets a little excited and really goes off the tennis deep-end. Also, he presents some "real life" experiences and includes dialog of these events. While instructful and useful, Gallwey has a tendency to share dialog that isn't 100% believable. I'm certainly not calling into question whether or not these experiences ocurred, he has a tendency to share dialog that basically repeats whatever idea he's talking about. "Wow, if I really focus on self 2, it DOES work". Like cmon man.
