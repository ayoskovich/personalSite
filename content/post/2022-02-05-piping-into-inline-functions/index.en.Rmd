I recently discovered that it's possible to pipe a dataframe into an anonymous function like the following:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

tibble(val=c('a', 'a', 'b')) %>% 
  (
    function(x){
      z <- '15'
      
      x %>%
        tail(2) %>% 
        mutate(foo = z)
    }
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

I've found this to be helpful when I need to create some sort of intermediate dataframe during the processing but don't want to clutter the environment with a bunch of things named `cleaned` / `cleaned2` / `final_cleaned`.

The one drawback is that it's kind of hard to debug, but I'm not sure if that outweighs how much cleaner it is environment-wise.
