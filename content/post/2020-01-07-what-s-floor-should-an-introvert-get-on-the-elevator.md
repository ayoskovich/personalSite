While waiting to hop on the elevator today I had a thought, and allow me to be incredibly dramatic about something. Elevators can lend themselves to awkward encounters. For example, imagine you're on the 3rd floor (out of 10) waiting to go to the 1st floor. The elevator opens up but you see the dreaded "up" arrow, meaning you have to just stand there while the doors close after an excrutiating amount of time. However, the lowest and highest floor spare an individual from the chance of this happening. On these floors, there is only one direction for the elevator to go, thus sparing you from the potential for an awkward encounter. 

I would be very curious to learn how elevators route themselves, then, given a distribution of riders, answer questions about when / where to get on the elevator in order to minimize the probability of these types of awkward encounters. Work for the weekend...
