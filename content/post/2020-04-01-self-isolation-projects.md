With my internship ending soon and me having lots of time on my hands I've been kind of puttering around with some stuff. I recently found some data from the Office of Personnel management that is kind of a good data wrangling exercise. Also, I'm going to work on some operations research stuff. I'm planning on rewriting _Linear Programming and Extensions_ by George B. Danzig in LaTeX. Also, I'd like to use `scipy` in order to solve some of the operations research problems he poses in this paper. Keep an eye on my github repo for more info.
